        <h2> Pritchett family</h2>
        <p> Older dad Jay deals with a few embaressing moments as strangers mistake his second wife Gloria for his daughter.
            Manny, Gloria's son with her first husband, wasn't always a fan of Jay. So much so that he chose the first song 
            for their wedding, Beauty and the Beast!  And although he loves, loud and loving mum, Gloria, he's not a big fan of the 
            cute names she calls him in public!  Jay and Gloria go on to have son, Joe, together. 
            Joe adds another layer of hilarity to the Prothett family and brings a little bit of shame when 
            he steals the priest's wallet. And then there's Stella, a destructive French Bulldog, who Gloria thinks 
            Jay shows more love to than her.
