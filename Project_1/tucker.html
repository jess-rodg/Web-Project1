        <h2> Pritchett-Tucker family</h2>
        <p> Rule follower, Lawyer Mitchell and his excentric, farm raised husband Cam are raising daughter Lily through her teen years, trying to navigate all the experiences that come with being a teenage girl, ones often they can't relate to. Lily loves her dads, but hates when she has to judge their <q>who wears it best</q> deabates when they put on the same outfit before going out. Renting out the top floor of their house leads to a whole host of interesting people coming into their lives, from a christian rock band to Cam's newly released from prison sister. The pritchett-Tucker household is very loud but never short on love! </p>
